## Major Architectural Changes

### 1. Database Refactoring (v1 → v2 Migration)

**Status**: ✅ **CONFIRMED**
**File**: `src/lib/catalog/db.ts`

**Description**:
Complete rewrite of the database schema from a single `catalog` table to a split architecture optimized for performance and memory efficiency.

**Changes**:
- **Split architecture**:
  - `volumes` table: Stores metadata only (series/volume titles, UUIDs, page counts, character counts, thumbnails)
  - `volumes_data` table: Stores heavy data (OCR pages, image File objects)
- **Automatic migration**: Users on v1 are automatically upgraded with `.upgrade()` function (lines 31-58)
- **Background thumbnail generation**: Processes 5 thumbnails at a time in batches (line 66)
- **Natural sorting**: File names sorted with locale-aware numeric sorting (lines 7-9)
- **UI feedback**: `isUpgrading` store for showing migration progress

**Impact**:
- Faster catalog loading (metadata only)
- Reduced memory usage (data loaded on-demand)
- Better scalability for large libraries
- One-way migration (no rollback)

---

### 2. Multi-Provider Cloud Storage Architecture

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** (Google Drive, MEGA) + 🟡 **WIP** (WebDAV)
**Files**:
- `src/lib/util/sync/provider-interface.ts`
- `src/lib/util/sync/providers/google-drive/google-drive-provider.ts`
- `src/lib/util/sync/providers/mega/mega-provider.ts`
- `src/lib/util/sync/providers/webdav/webdav-provider.ts`

**Description**:
Transformed from Google Drive-only to a fully extensible multi-provider cloud storage system with unified interfaces.

**Architecture**:

1. **Provider Interface** (`SyncProvider`):
   - Common contract for all cloud storage providers
   - Type-safe with discriminated unions
   - Provider-specific optimizations while maintaining unified API

2. **Implemented Providers**:
   - ✅ **Google Drive**: Fully operational with OAuth2
   - ✅ **MEGA**: Fully operational with email/password auth
   - 🟡 **WebDAV**: Untested, marked "Under Development" in UI

3. **Provider-Specific Features**:
   - Concurrency limits per provider (configurable)
   - Worker download support flags
   - Custom error handling and retry logic
   - Provider-specific metadata types

**Concurrency Limits**:
- Google Drive: upload 4, download 4
- MEGA: upload 6, download 6
- WebDAV: upload 2, download 2

**Export Pseudo-Provider**:
- Special "provider" for local browser downloads
- Works uniformly with backup queue=
- Allows for fast multithreaded volume exports

---

### 3. Memory-Efficient Upload System

**Status**: ✅ **CONFIRMED**
**File**: `src/lib/upload/index.ts`

**Description**:
Complete rewrite of the file upload system to handle large ZIP files without out-of-memory errors. Streams data instead of loading everything into memory at once.

**Key Improvements**:

1. **Streaming ZIP Processing**:
   - Uses `ZipReaderStream` instead of `ZipReader` (line 281)
   - Processes entries one at a time
   - Frees memory immediately after processing each entry

2. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Converts streams directly to ArrayBuffer (line 288)
   - Avoids intermediate Blob writes to disk
   - Creates File objects directly from ArrayBuffer (line 291)
   - No double-buffering

3. **Nested ZIP Support**:
   - Recursively processes ZIP within ZIP
   - Handles embedded mokuro files in archives
   - Handles embedded archives in ZIPs

4. **Intelligent File Pairing**:
   - Mokuro JSON files paired with corresponding images
   - Handles various folder structures
   - Pending images system for async pairing

5. **Problematic Path Filtering**:
   - Excludes system directories: `__MACOSX`, `.DS_Store`, etc.
   - Filters `._*` hidden files (lines 230-235)
   - Comprehensive list of Windows/Linux/macOS system files (lines 186-224)
