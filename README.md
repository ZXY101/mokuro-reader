## Usage

You can find the reader hosted [here](https://reader.mokuro.app/).

To import your manga, process it with mokuro and then upload your manga along with the generated `.mokuro` file.

As of the moment base mokuro does not generate the `.mokuro` file, you need to install and use `mokuro 0.2.0-beta.6`.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro.git@web-reader
```

Once installed and your manga is processed, import your manga into the reader.
