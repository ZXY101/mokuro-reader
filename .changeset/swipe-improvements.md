Improved mobile touch gestures

- Swipe-to-page now works reliably on high-refresh-rate and high-DPI devices (e.g., Galaxy Fold 5)
- Pinch-zoom no longer accidentally triggers page turns
- Added pan-while-pinch: move two fingers together to pan while zooming
- Pinch-zoom now respects screen bounds (can't zoom out past fit-to-screen)
- New "Swipe sensitivity" setting replaces the old threshold slider
